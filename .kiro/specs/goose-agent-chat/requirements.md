# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a universal goose-lib module that provides agent chat functionality using the goose framework. The module will be designed to work seamlessly in both axum web server routes and tauri desktop applications, providing a consistent interface for AI agent interactions across different deployment contexts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a universal goose agent chat module, so that I can integrate AI chat functionality into both web and desktop applications with consistent behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the module is imported THEN it SHALL provide a unified interface for agent chat operations
2. WHEN used in axum routes THEN the module SHALL handle HTTP-based chat requests and responses
3. WHEN used in tauri applications THEN the module SHALL handle tauri command-based chat interactions
4. WHEN initialized THEN the module SHALL configure the goose agent with appropriate model settings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the chat module to handle streaming responses, so that users can see real-time AI responses as they are generated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a chat request is made THEN the system SHALL support streaming responses
2. WHEN streaming is enabled THEN the system SHALL emit incremental response chunks
3. WHEN streaming completes THEN the system SHALL signal completion to the client
4. IF streaming fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide fallback responses

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable agent settings, so that I can customize the AI behavior for different use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the module THEN the system SHALL accept configuration parameters for the agent
2. WHEN configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL apply model settings, provider settings, and behavior parameters
3. WHEN no configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL use sensible default settings
4. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL return clear error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging, so that I can debug issues and provide good user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN client requests fail THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses
3. WHEN the agent fails to initialize THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL handle timeouts and retries appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want thread-safe operations, so that the module can handle concurrent requests safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple requests are made concurrently THEN the system SHALL handle them safely without data races
2. WHEN the runtime is shared THEN the system SHALL use proper synchronization mechanisms
3. WHEN agent state is accessed THEN the system SHALL ensure thread-safe operations
4. WHEN cleanup is needed THEN the system SHALL properly dispose of resources

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want message history management, so that conversations can maintain context across multiple interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conversation starts THEN the system SHALL initialize an empty message history
2. WHEN messages are exchanged THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context
3. WHEN history becomes too long THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate truncation strategies
4. WHEN conversation ends THEN the system SHALL provide options to clear or persist history
