# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the incorrect usage of the rig library in the `rig-agent/src/core/agent.rs` file. The current implementation has several issues with how it creates and uses rig-core agents, including incorrect imports, improper model instantiation, and misaligned API usage. The goal is to fix these issues to properly integrate with the rig ecosystem.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the rig-agent library, I want the agent creation to use the correct rig library APIs, so that the agents can be properly instantiated and function correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating an AI provider instance THEN the system SHALL use the correct rig provider crate imports (rig-openai, rig-anthropic, etc.)
2. WHEN initializing a model THEN the system SHALL use the proper rig model creation patterns
3. WHEN storing the agent instance THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate rig Agent trait instead of CompletionModel directly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the agent to properly handle tool integration with rig-core, so that tools can be attached to agents and function calls work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating an agent with tools enabled THEN the system SHALL properly attach tools using rig's tool system
2. WHEN processing tool calls THEN the system SHALL use rig's native tool execution flow
3. WHEN tools are disabled THEN the system SHALL create agents without tool attachments

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the chat functionality to use rig's proper completion patterns, so that conversations work reliably with all supported providers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending a chat message THEN the system SHALL use rig's Agent.prompt() or similar methods instead of direct completion calls
2. WHEN building conversation context THEN the system SHALL use rig's message building patterns
3. WHEN handling responses THEN the system SHALL properly extract content and tool calls from rig responses

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling for rig-specific errors, so that failures are properly caught and reported.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rig operations fail THEN the system SHALL catch and convert rig errors to AgentError types
2. WHEN provider initialization fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
3. WHEN model calls fail THEN the system SHALL handle timeouts and API errors gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the agent configuration to properly map to rig model parameters, so that temperature, max_tokens, and other settings are correctly applied.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating an agent with custom temperature THEN the system SHALL apply the temperature to the rig model
2. WHEN setting max_tokens THEN the system SHALL configure the rig model's token limits
3. WHEN using system prompts THEN the system SHALL integrate them into rig's agent system
